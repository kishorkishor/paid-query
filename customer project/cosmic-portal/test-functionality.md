What’s Still Missing vs. final.md / Legacy PHP

Wallet and order data – there are no JSON endpoints for wallet balance/history, order list/details, carton payments, or bank listings. The current wallet/orders screens therefore continue to show mocked data. To finish Phase 4 you’ll need new PHP APIs that return the same data the PHP templates currently pull from MySQL (public_html/customer/wallet.php, orders.php, etc.).
Negotiation/OTP/payment flows – endpoints such as customer_query_actions.php, wallet_capture.php, and carton tools in public_html/app/* aren’t exposed to the SPA. We only surface the read-only parts (list/stats/details). Decide whether to:
add new PHP JSON routes for those mutations, or
migrate that logic into Next.js API routes with direct DB access.
Mock API routes (src/app/api/mock/*) are still present; remove them once the real PHP environment is reachable everywhere.
How to Run

Set env vars:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=/api/proxy/api (default), PHP_BACKEND_URL=https://<your-host>/api
Clerk: NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, CLERK_SECRET_KEY
Install deps (npm install) – sonner is already added.
Build/test (npm run build). Warning about “multiple lockfiles” is upstream and can be ignored or fix by removing unrelated lockfiles.
Launch dev server (npm run dev) and ensure your proxy can reach the PHP host.
Next Steps

Expose wallet/order JSON endpoints in PHP (balance/history, order list/detail, carton states, bank accounts) so the SPA can render those modules with real data.
Extend the proxy pattern to any new endpoints and remove the temporary placeholders in api.ts.
Add Clerk-protected routes/pages for wallet payments once the backend APIs exist.
Update test-functionality.md to reflect the current (partially integrated) state so QA doesn’t assume everything is “fully functional”.
